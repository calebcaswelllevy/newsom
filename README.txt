To install the game on a MAC, open the Terminal app. 

If you don't know the path to the folder that this game is in, there is a trick. If you click on the install.sh file and drag it into
the terminal, terminal will fill in where the file is. if you do this on a blank line, it should look something like this:

        /Users/YourUserNameHere/Downloads/newsom/install.sh
                 ^ your user name should be here, and this assumes the folder is in downloads.

Ok, so once you have done that, you want to prefix that pathway with the zsh command. 
This just tells your computer to run the script in the zsh language. It should look like this, with 'zsh' followed by one space, 
followed by the file pathway:

        zsh /Users/YourUserNameHere/Downloads/newsom/install.sh

Hit enter, and if all is well and I don't suck, it should install the game.

Once that is done, you can play by opening terminal, and typing 'newsom' to play. If it doesn't work, restart terminal and try again.
